- Started implementing [IWE word embeddings](https://aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI17/paper/view/14724) using PyTorch. They have their source code but it is written in C# :eyes: which is terrible for someone like me. Nonetheless, I hope I can implement it and find it to be performing better for my Query Expansion task!

### 3rd March 2019
- Finished Word Embedding [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html) by Pytorch. It is part of the Deep Learning for NLP [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_nlp_tutorial.html). Skipped the last [slide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/advanced_tutorial.html) for later, seemed a bit too advanced.

- There's not much difference between skip-gram and CBOW performance and really depends on the task. 
- However, it is important to keep in mind, for the same amount of data skip-gram (predictiong context from word) gets `N` times more training than CBOW (predicting word from context) where `N` is the context window :bulb:

### 25th February 2019
- Started following [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8PYTP1V4I8Ajj7sY6sdtmjgkt7eo2VMs) by Graham Neubig. Excellent series of videos to teach us about use of Neural Networks in NLP. They have links to their [github repo](https://github.com/neubig/nn4nlp-code) as well, which gave me the much needed kick to start learning pyTorch as well. 

- Working on the Literature Review is ongoing.

- Okay not everyone appreciates markdown. Specially, non-technical people.

- **Realisation**: Markdown is probably the best place to write informal things and thoughts. Specially for the forgetful like me. It looks cool too. 


- **Literature Review for my thesis**: The first draft completely tanked. [Claudia](chauff.github.io), my supervisor, could not finish reading the chapter - it was *that* bad. Nonetheless, time to improve my writing. We hardly have any *writing* practice in India. It's the system's fault, not mine. Aggregate findings and prior work, instead of simply writing two sentences about them! 

- However, [proposal](https://github.com/roynirmal/queryExpWikiPassageQA/blob/master/homerun.md) for the final part of my thesis was approved!
