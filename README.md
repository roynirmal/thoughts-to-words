# thoughts-to-words

### 19th February 2019

**Realisation**: Markdown is probably the best place to write informal things and thoughts. Specially for the forgetful like me. It looks cool too. 


**Literature Review for my thesis**: The first draft completely tanked. [Claudia](chauff.github.io), my supervisor, could not finish reading the chapter - it was *that* bad. Nonetheless, time to improve my writing. We hardly have any *writing* practice in India. It's the system's fault, not mine. Aggregate findings and prior work, instead of simply writing two sentences about them! 

However, [proposal](https://github.com/roynirmal/queryExpWikiPassageQA/blob/master/homerun.md) for the final part of my thesis was approved!
