Started following [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8PYTP1V4I8Ajj7sY6sdtmjgkt7eo2VMs) by Graham Neubig. Excellent series of videos to teach us about use of Neural Networks in NLP. They have links to their github repo as well, which gave me the much needed kick to start learning pyTorch as well. 

Working on the Literature Review is ongoing.

Okay not everyone appreciates markdown. Specially, non-technical people.

**Realisation**: Markdown is probably the best place to write informal things and thoughts. Specially for the forgetful like me. It looks cool too. 


**Literature Review for my thesis**: The first draft completely tanked. [Claudia](chauff.github.io), my supervisor, could not finish reading the chapter - it was *that* bad. Nonetheless, time to improve my writing. We hardly have any *writing* practice in India. It's the system's fault, not mine. Aggregate findings and prior work, instead of simply writing two sentences about them! 

However, [proposal](https://github.com/roynirmal/queryExpWikiPassageQA/blob/master/homerun.md) for the final part of my thesis was approved!
