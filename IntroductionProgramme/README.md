| **Action Points** | **We nailed it!**  | **Could be better** | **General Remarks** |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Movie Night**   | - 13 participants including Marjo, Andrea, Emilio, cosy!<br> - Nice venue for Spring(not for summer)            |- Need to prepare betterissue with DVD<br>- need to download movie in the laptop from DVD but need to have the original DVD there<br> - Weather and timing did not help :umbrella:<br> - In a 2 day program, movie is not an interactive activity, students would prefer to NOT attend the movie           |                 |
| **ESN International Evening** |  - At professor, dinner was fine<br> - Organisation in every spot was good. But not huge crowd maybe they left. Andrea saw around 3-4 groups of 20              |  - Couple of occasion it was getting cringy and activity was awkward<br> - Pub quiz was not done well<br> - We were not aware there was an after party             | - They thought it went well but they do not have any specific feedback and asked us for more information             |
|          **Campus Rally**     |     - They were excited and the coaches were really interested and competitive :horse_racing:<br> - Calculation of score was really good plus the organization on  a whole            | - Logistics might be improved for example in spoon challenge<br> - clear communication regarding where will the challenge take place:mega: <br>  - Coaches might not have understood the Quiz/clue and then go to the places           |- Flag challenge at Pulse might not be feasible for summer because it needs a lot of preparations<br> Shoe challenge venue were either in hallway or classrooms, might be in the open<br> - Some coaches sent the results a bit late but that was expected. Maybe have a time limit  |
