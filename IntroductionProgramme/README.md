**Hand out Chocolates**  :chocolate_bar:
- [ ]	Student Survey to be sent out by 20th February 2019

| **Tasks and Events** | **We nailed it!**  | **Could be better** | **General Remarks** |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
|      **Communication to Students**        |   - Movies were good . first teaser covered all students, second one did not reach all students.  140 views for how to get to delft. <br> *Closing movie blocked by youtube*, we need to choose licensed songs. Videos went pretty well. <br> Filming during IP was cool too. Working with crew than social media coaches much more easy. <br> No students objected to being on the film< - Email : good thing to adjust the text. Efficient and worked <br> - Apps: Downloaded by everyone! :space_invader:  Bu they removed it after IP, did not use it for the 'Activities after IP'|           - Website: Faculty information not uniform.      |   - How to not include people in videos who doesn’t want to be in the films? <br>Solutions – contact these people and blur out their faces while the film is on production. Both parties have to be responsible. Students have to say they don’t want an we must be aware.  |
|     **Communication in the team**         |   - Script: was a very good and the script reading session was really nice :page_with_curl:<br> Roles: everyone was happy :family: <br>  Preparation – we did well ! |                 |                 |
| **Registration Desk/Info Point**          | - Already assembled bags!<br> It was nice atmosphere and the crowd was perfect, it was cozy               | - We had to give them way more information<br> - For the payment card it was unclear and Aula did not know<br> - Communication of Registration might be better               |  - Its better to be at the same level with the student than sitting               |
| **Free Lunch + Borrel + Toastable**              |  - Quality of lunch<br> Toastable was really helpful and nice. Service was really nice<br> - Dance was fun. Idea of putting Sosalsa in café for second day was nice :dancer:          | - Quantity of lunch<br> - SoSalsa was really a lot of teaching and less fun. Maybe they could have given a performance like DDC.                |   - Why were there two lines? For beer and food:question: <br> - Coin system for summer is necessary otherwise queue might explode<br> - Second borrel was quieter. But expected. |
|    **Opening**           |  ‘’  It was excellent. Best Opening in the history of Opening ‘’ – Sophie, the opener:bomb:               |                 |          - In summer, maybe different crew can tell about various events.        |
|       **Info Bazar**        |    - Organisation wise it was good             |    -  It was quiet. Was not very crowded<br> - We had to tell coaches to get them to Info Bazar.             |  - . People had t ocome at 12 to the welcome desk so they did not come earlier to info bazar<br> - Few stands had more than 4 representative.                |
| **Movie Night**   | - 13 participants including Marjo, Andrea, Emilio, cosy!<br> - Nice venue for Spring(not for summer)            |- Need to prepare betterissue with DVD<br>- need to download movie in the laptop from DVD but need to have the original DVD there<br> - Weather and timing did not help :umbrella:<br> - In a 2 day program, movie is not an interactive activity, students would prefer to NOT attend the movie           |                 |
| **ESN International Evening** |  - At professor, dinner was fine<br> - Organisation in every spot was good. But not huge crowd maybe they left. Andrea saw around 3-4 groups of 20              |  - Couple of occasion it was getting cringy and activity was awkward<br> - Pub quiz was not done well<br> - We were not aware there was an after party             | - They thought it went well but they do not have any specific feedback and asked us for more information             |
|     **Intercultural Communication Workshop**          |    -It was better than the lecture where there was a lot of stereotypes<br> - Really Interactive <br>-  Bob is great.         |   There were few murmurs about the lecture being stereotypical and also the ‘gay’ comment.              |   -Bob was not in his usual form. Normally, he is good. Is this a subject he likes giving lectures about ?   |
|          **Campus Rally**     |     - They were excited and the coaches were really interested and competitive :horse_racing:<br> - Calculation of score was really good plus the organization on  a whole            | - Logistics might be improved for example in spoon challenge<br> - clear communication regarding where will the challenge take place:mega: <br>  - Coaches might not have understood the Quiz/clue and then go to the places           |- Flag challenge at Pulse might not be feasible for summer because it needs a lot of preparations<br> Shoe challenge venue were either in hallway or classrooms, might be in the open<br> - Some coaches sent the results a bit late but that was expected. Maybe have a time limit :alarm_clock:  |
|     **Peer to peer feedback workshop**          | - Most of the coaches were super engaged<br> - We should keep It in the program. It is useful and valuable<br> - It was good that it was scheduled after campus rally. They were not sleepy<br> - The movie was thrilling. Oscar is coming up, shall we book tickets?:trophy:             |                 | - One group Kryztof, skipped the lecture. We can ask the coaches about how it went<br> - Did the coaches have question they could not answer? How did they feel being the moderator? :question:     |
|   **Coaches/Team Building/Dinner**          |  - Francesc was helpful.           |  - Quite long for team building <br> - Isa: too drunk. Maybe we need to be a bit more firm<br>-  Kryztof: he cannot take decisions by himself. He took wrong decisions <br> - Maaz was new and he had a lot of questions. He was too much overwhelming with the group, maybe he was way too outgoing<br> -  Praveen was opposite of Maaz.  Not very proactive.            |   -    Some students might not have bonded well. It may be their character, or the duration of the programme, or the coach.          |
|    **Party**           | - Dj was fine But was a bit creepy <br> - audio visual stuff worked               | - too crowded, warm, some agreements with Hangout was not made <br> - They said it can hold 350 people but we had only 250 <br> - There are no cloakrooms/and to store bags <br> - Crew did not finish meal or get second round of dinner. Hangout was late.  Not organized time wise <br> - Dj booth area: everyone was putting their jacket there and the security lady did not do anything. People were hitting the speaker<br> - Dj had to manually turn the volume at  max.  They had a small speaker. Hangout should have done it better <br> - Security at party -  maybe it was a bit too aggressive:police_car:           |   - Given the money saved  it was a good party :money_with_wings:	<br> - we  can co organize parties to not have the hassle of cleaning up.              |
