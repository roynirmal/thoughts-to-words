| **Action Points** | **We nailed it!**  | **Could be better** | **General Remarks** |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Movie Night**   | - 13 participants including Marjo, Andrea, Emilio, cosy!<br> - Nice venue for Spring(not for summer)            |- Need to prepare betterissue with DVD<br>- need to download movie in the laptop from DVD but need to have the original DVD there<br> - Weather and timing did not help :umbrella:<br> - In a 2 day program, movie is not an interactive activity, students would prefer to NOT attend the movie           |                 |
| **ESN International Evening** |  - At professor, dinner was fine<br> - Organisation in every spot was good. But not huge crowd maybe they left. Andrea saw around 3-4 groups of 20              |  - Couple of occasion it was getting cringy and activity was awkward<br> - Pub quiz was not done well<br> - We were not aware there was an after party             | - They thought it went well but they do not have any specific feedback and asked us for more information             |
|          **Campus Rally**     |     - They were excited and the coaches were really interested and competitive :horse_racing:<br> - Calculation of score was really good plus the organization on  a whole            | - Logistics might be improved for example in spoon challenge<br> - clear communication regarding where will the challenge take place:mega: <br>  - Coaches might not have understood the Quiz/clue and then go to the places           |- Flag challenge at Pulse might not be feasible for summer because it needs a lot of preparations<br> Shoe challenge venue were either in hallway or classrooms, might be in the open<br> - Some coaches sent the results a bit late but that was expected. Maybe have a time limit :alarm_clock:  |
| **Registration Desk/Info Point**          | - Already assembled bags!<br> It was nice atmosphere and the crowd was perfect, it was cozy               | - We had to give them way more information<br> - For the payment card it was unclear and Aula did not know<br> - Communication of Registration might be better               |  - Its better to be at the same level with the student than sitting               |
| **Free Lunch + Borrel + Toastable**              |  - Quality of lunch<br> Toastable was really helpful and nice. Service was really nice<br> - Dance was fun. Idea of putting Sosalsa in café for second day was nice :dancer:          | - Quantity of lunch<br> - SoSalsa was really a lot of teaching and less fun. Maybe they could have given a performance like DDC.                |   - Why were there two lines? For beer and food:question: <br> - Coin system for summer is necessary otherwise queue might explode<br> - Second borrel was quieter. But expected. |
|       **Info Bazar**        |    - Organisation wise it was good             |    -  It was quiet. Was not very crowded<br> - We had to tell coaches to get them to Info Bazar.             |  - . People had t ocome at 12 to the welcome desk so they did not come earlier to info bazar<br> - Few stands had more than 4 representative.                |
|    **Opening**           |  ‘’  It was excellent. Best Opening in the history of Opening ‘’ – Sophie, the opener:bomb:               |                 |          - In summer, maybe different crew can tell about various events.        |
|     **Intercultural Communication Workshop**          |    -It was better than the lecture where there was a lot of stereotypes<br> - Really Interactive <br>-  Bob is great.         |   There were few murmurs about the lecture being stereotypical and also the ‘gay’ comment.              |   -Bob was not in his usual form. Normally, he is good. Is this a subject he likes giving lectures about ?   |
|     **Peer to peer feedback workshop**          | - Most of the coaches were super engaged<br> - We should keep It in the program. It is useful and valuable<br> - It was good that it was scheduled after campus rally. They were not sleepy<br> - The movie was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Oscar is coming up, shall we book tickets?:trophy:             |                 | - One group Kryztof, skipped the lecture. We can ask the coaches about how it went<br> - Did the coaches have question they could not answer? How did they feel being the moderator? :question:     |
|               |                |                 |                 |
|               |                |                 |                 |
|               |                |                 |                 |
|               |                |                 |                 |
